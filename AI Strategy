AI Strategy

AI is a tool and nothing else. Really it's a set of tools.
If someone develops AGI then we can worry about non-tool applicaitons later.
AI is a tool like cutlery.

Cutlery: What is our cutlery strategy?
    - cutlery is a new tool used for food consumption
    - the private sector routinely uses cutlery for food consumption
    - cutlery can be used for almost all food consuption in the department.
    - we should impliment cutlery everywhere that it can be implimented
However:
    - Obvious reasons the above stratgy is not actually a good strategy:
        sandwiches.
        no-one needs a knife to eat yoghurt.
        sometimes contracte, the private sector, and the public should use their own cutlery to save on washing up
    - This is not a cutlery implimentation strategy, and clearly makes no conceptual progress. "Can haz AI?" is not a strategy.
    - The problem is that cutlery is not one tool at one level of sophisticaion
        - a knife, fork and spoon are specialised
        - you can use a regular knife to eat steak, but a steak knife is better
    - The temptation is to classity tasks by complexity, but this is wrong: a "complex cultery item" still has too many different functions to apply.
        - "Where can we use deep learning?" is roughly equivalent to asking: "Where can I apply slotted spoons, nut-crackers and butter knives?"
        - There is no meaninful systematic way to answer either question.
    - Equally, it's temption to classify a task by how useful cutlery is to the task.
        - "Which tasks can be completely automated?" is roughly equivalent to asking: "Who eats the fewest sandwiches in the department?"
        - At best this can give you a list of potential projects for cutlery. It is not a strategy cannot lead to strategic decision making.
        - It fails to answer the question, "What is cutlery good for?"
    - A better set of questions to ask are: what are the basic functions of cutlery?
        - cutting, scooping, stirring, and spearing
        - combination functions like: spearing something in place to for cutting

    - What needs scooping the deparment?
        -  soup, yoghurt.
    - Let's impliment spoons wherever there is soup and yoghurt.
    - Now we have reduced the strategy issue to a series of governance and implimentation issues:
        - Are there any other scooping activitise we have missed? How can we keep abreast of new scooping needs?
        - Where does the department have soup and yoghurt?
        - Which soup and yoghurt areas should get spoons first?
        - Are there any complex scooping needs (such as using a long handled, slotted spoon too scoop chips out of boiling oil)?

So, the first question we nee to answer is: what are the basic functions of AI?

Level 1, functions and inputs
Recognise - Process - Generate
[What is underneath these?]

This is still too generic, we need to define different inputs. 
    - Images (of things, of documenets)
    - Text (typed, handwriited)
    - Audio
    - Strutured data

Now we can populate each square with examples:
Recognise
    - read the values on a return [digitisation is better than machine learning e.g. make it a digital form! ML shouldn't cover bad design]
    - categorise the topic of a letter
    - transcribe the audio of a call

Now we can map these tasks onto existing our tasks:
    What are the our tasks?
    [What is our prcoess look like input, process, output]

A note on DSOs
    - AI should help us to delvier our DSO
    - A generic AI strategy should not necessarily be phrased in terms of DSOs. Why?
    - We already carries out functions in terms of DSOs - AI can either deliver those DSO benefits or not, and it can either deliver them better or not.
    - The DSO justification for AI in general is as superficial as the jusitification for using a computer - it can make life cheaper, quicker and better.
    - If AI can answer the phones, that doesn't sui generis change the benefits of answering the phones, only the cost and efficiency.
    - There is an edge case, which is where AI lets us do something we couldn't have done before because it was too time consuming or too difficult.
    - Then we need to make a new case in terms of DSOs because we're not sure if the task is inherently worth doing. 
    - For example, NLP based translation services would allow staff to routinely inspect tax documents from other countries without the cost of a translator, but we don't do it now and don't know what the benefit would be.
    - The magic square:
        - We can already eat steak without special tools, but knives make eating steak easier so we use them. (Existing benefits, with new tools)
        - It's hard to eat lobster without special lobster eating cutlery, so we use the special tools. (New benefits, with new tools)
        - It's also hard to eat rocks without special tools, but we don't bother with those tools. (No benefits, with new tools)
        - For completeness, some tasks (sandwiches) don't need new tools.
    - There is no way to distinguish between potential AI applications on a theoretical level - it's the combination of task and tool which defines the exact form of the benefits case.
    
    
Types of goal for applications / Applications (?)


Make routine tasks automatic
Letter generation
Tailored advice
Automatic information provision for staff
Real time script generation for contact staff
Intelligent prompts for customers (Personalisation)
Case allocation for regions
[Clever spell checking]
[auto translation]
Identify anomolous behaviour automatically (risk, error, unknown threats, cyber sec)
Improving website and guidance usibility


[What can Amazon Echo do?]
[Language generation]
[self-driving cars]
[IoT]


Approaches

Contracted out
Off the self products
In house capability

Barriers

Tier 1
Identifying areas for Applications

    -industry use cases
    -staff workshops
Complexity of the problem
complexity of the solutions
Credibility of the solutions
Legislative (?)
Ethical (?)
The 1984 effect (can staff trust us?)

Tier 2
Environments
Tooling
Data
Capability (?)

Ideas

Replace mundane low value tasks with higher value tasks (reading letters? )
Provide intelligent assistance to staff (see Fujitsu)
Identify anomolous behaviour automatically, especially  (see Dark Trace)
Improve customer service (recorded speech to test, correlate with outcomes)
Improve routing (short calls ?)
Identify blockers (going further than letter sorting (e.g. IT behaviour)
